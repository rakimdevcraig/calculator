How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery

I first figured out how to add addition to the calculator and I took those principles to apply to the other operations.

Optimizations:
When I have the time I will get around to adding the % and instead of the user inputting the numbers I will have numbers as buttons.

Lessons Learned:
I learned that when you find a way to do one thing it can be applied to other parts of your work. Once I found out how to add it wasn't hard adding the other operations to the calculator.

Examples:
